# SuperMarketManagementSystem
I have created a Grocery management system in Java using Swing GUI and file handling  
`The demo of the project is given at the link:`  

`The use cases included in the project include:`  
*Login using a registered account  
*Sign up to the system  
*View products in different categories  
*View personal details  
*Change Password  
*View Previous orders  
*Log out  
`The program checks if the user is a previous buyer, then he receives an exclusive discount of 25% on new orders above 5000`    
*How To Run*    
1. Extract the SuperMarketManagementSystem.zip in a folder  
2. Open Netbeans. Click on Open project and open the extracted project folder  
3. Expand the source packages -> default packages -> main.java  
4. Run the main.java
